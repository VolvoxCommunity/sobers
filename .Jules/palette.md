## 2024-05-24 - Password Visibility Toggle

**Learning:** Users (and developers!) often struggle with complex password requirements if they can't see what they are typing. Adding a simple visibility toggle significantly reduces friction during signup and login, and is an expected standard feature.
**Action:** Always include a password visibility toggle for `secureTextEntry` fields, ensuring it is keyboard accessible and has proper ARIA labels ('Show password' / 'Hide password').
